### 📍 Project 1. Number Guessing Game
> This game generates random numbers from 1 to 100 and allows the user to guess the randomly generated number. When the user enters a number, it tells them whether the correct answer is higher or lower than the number they input. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game will inform them of the amount of attempts it took to guess correctly.
